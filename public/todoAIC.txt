todo.txt – Super Local AI Desktop App
0. Project Setup

 Choose programming language / framework (Electron + React for cross-platform desktop or native Python/Qt)

 Setup Git repo and branching strategy

 Choose state management for app (Redux, Zustand, or custom for session/history)

 Prepare basic app skeleton with window, sidebar, chat panel

1. Local AI Model Management

 Integrate local LLM support (e.g., llama.cpp, Mistral, Llama 2, Gemma)

 Display list of available models in UI (model name, size, status: downloaded/greyed out)

 Implement model download functionality (fetch from Hugging Face or external links)

 Show download progress & storage space used

 Allow user to delete models to free space

 Handle multiple models, switch between models easily in the UI

 Ensure model license info is visible (research-only vs commercial use)

2. Chat UI / UX

 Main chat panel: current conversation thread

 Sidebar: history of previous chats / sessions

 Input text box: multi-line, supports basic markdown formatting

 Send button + hotkey support (Enter, Shift+Enter)

 Thread management: start new chat, rename chats

 Scrollback support with smooth scrolling

3. File / Image Upload Integration

 Drag-and-drop file support (PDF, TXT, DOCX, CSV)

 Image support (PNG, JPG) for local analysis / embeddings

 Convert files/images into embeddings for the LLM to process locally

 Display uploaded files in chat for reference

 Option to remove files from session

4. Offline AI Functionality

 Query local model without internet

 Handle long responses efficiently (streaming or chunked output)

 Ensure models run in quantized / optimized mode for low RAM/GPU use

 Monitor system usage (CPU/GPU/RAM)

5. Web Search Feature (Premium)

 “Enable Web Search” toggle in settings

 Integrate search API (Bing, Brave, or Serper.dev)

 Implement server-side or local quota tracking per user (e.g., 1000 searches/month)

 Fetch top search snippets, feed them to the local model for summarization

 Display sources with citations

 Allow advanced users to input their own API key for unlimited search

 Handle API errors gracefully (quota exceeded, network errors)

6. Subscription / Monetization

 Free tier: local AI only, no web search, limited model access

 Premium tier ($6/month): web search enabled, 1,000 queries/month, multiple models

 Optional “BYO API key” for unlimited search, discounted subscription ($4/month)

 Payment integration (Stripe / Paddle / PayPal)

 Handle subscription validation, renewals, cancellations

7. Settings / User Management

 Sign in with email / Google account (optional)

 Track per-user search usage if turnkey API key is used

 API key input for BYO search key

 Storage management: show disk space used by downloaded models and cache

 Theme settings: light/dark mode

8. App Stability / Safety

 Save chat history & session state locally

 Handle app crashes, model download interruptions

 Display error messages clearly (file unsupported, API error, etc.)

 Add disclaimers for model licenses and web search accuracy

9. Optional Enhancements

 Multi-window support / detachable chat threads

 Multi-language support (prompt translation / multilingual embeddings)

 Vector DB integration (local, e.g., ChromaDB, for long-term file memory)

 Export chat sessions (TXT, PDF)

 Integrate plugins/extensions for future features
