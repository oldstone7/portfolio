README.md — Anti-PMO App Blueprint
Project Overview:

The Anti-PMO mobile app is designed to help users block pornography, nudity, adult content, and related thirst traps
 across social media, browsers, and apps, while preventing bypass through VPNs or system setting changes, when 
 urges hits. It employs multi-layered technical enforcement combined with an accountability framework involving 
 a trusted partner.


Section 1 – Core Security & Lock Features

1.1 PIN Lock System

On first launch, app prompts user to set a 6–8 digit PIN.

PIN is stored securely in local storage.

Every time app is opened, PIN entry screen appears first.

Lock also triggers if app is opened via recent apps screen or in any way.


1.2 DNS Enforcement Support

App does not force DNS itself.

Instead, the partner or user sets up DNS via their mobile Settings > Network Settings > enter their private DNS address which is,
family.cloudflare-dns.com (1.1.1.3 and 1.0.0.3) but our app needs to block access to only the specific part of the settings where DNS configuration
 can be done by locking the Network Settings section on Settings app (Every other settings part should be available for use, except the network settings part,
 which asks the pin as soon as the network settings is clicked) but other sections like Display, Profile/personalization and everything else.


1.3 App Info Protection

Prevents tampering (Force Stop, Clear Data, Uninstall).

When user tries to access App Info page of any app, the lock screen appears → requires PIN to continue.
We want to implement prevention of users force stopping, disabling or clear data of our app.


1.4 PIN Management

Our PMO App should have settings page which include a “Change PIN” option.

To change PIN: user must enter old PIN first, then create a new 6–8 digit PIN with retype pin again verification.


Section 2 – App Protection & Monitoring


2.1 Installation Lock (Preventing New Apps)

The app monitors the Package Installer using Accessibility Service.

Whenever a new app installation is initiated, a lock screen prompt will appear requiring the PIN.
and if the user already clicked the install for an app, we should cancel the install.

User could never be able to install anything on this app without the pin.
Without the correct PIN, installation is blocked.

This prevents users from installing VPNs, alternate browsers, or apps that could bypass restrictions.

Note: Only installations are blocked. Uninstalling other apps (games, social apps, unused apps, etc.) remains free and unhindered for the user.
Meaning we shouldn't lock the package installer. Uninstall should happen freely (except our own app) and installation only should be blocked.
Uninstall Protection (Only for Anti-PMO App)

Our Anti-PMO app itself cannot be uninstalled easily.

This is achieved by making the app a Device Admin App.

To disable or uninstall, the user must first deactivate admin rights from within the app settings, which requires the PIN to enter the app in the
first place.

This ensures that even tech-savvy users cannot bypass protections without knowing the PIN.

2.2 Blocking Accessibility Settings Page

The Accessibility Service is critical for monitoring installs and VPN usage.

To prevent the user from disabling it, the app blocks access to the Accessibility Service settings page in the device Settings app.

Other parts of Settings remain usable, only this page is locked.

2.3 Accountability Notifications

To involve the accountability partner effectively, the app sends SMS or instant notifications in these cases:

Wrong PIN Attempt → If someone tries to enter a wrong PIN, the partner is alerted.

New App Installed → Every successful app installation notifies the partner.

These alerts help partners keep the user accountable in real-time.
