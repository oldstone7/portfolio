Germany
Germany has a significant shortage of IT professionals, and many tech hubs, such as Berlin, offer many roles that operate in English. The country offers several pathways for foreign job seekers, even for those without a university degree. 
Where to find jobs:
Job boards: GermanTechJobs.de is a great resource for tech roles. General job sites like LinkedIn and Indeed are also widely used.
Company websites: Look for positions directly on the careers pages of major tech companies and startups based in Germany. For example, some companies that recruit internationally include N26, Delivery Hero, and Contentful.
Networking: Participate in online tech communities, especially on LinkedIn, to connect with recruiters and professionals in your field. 
How to apply:
For recent graduates and skilled workers: The EU Blue Card is a popular route if you have a recognized university degree and a job offer that meets the minimum salary requirements.
For IT specialists without a degree: If you have at least three years of relevant professional experience within the last seven years, you may qualify for a Blue Card with a slightly lower salary threshold, provided you have a job offer of at least six months.
The Opportunity Card (Chancenkarte): Launched in 2024, this visa allows skilled workers from non-EU countries to enter Germany for up to 12 months to search for a qualified job. Requirements vary based on a points system or recognition of your qualifications. 
Canada
Canada has a thriving tech industry and has created several immigration pathways to attract global tech talent. 
Where to find jobs:
Global job boards: LinkedIn and Indeed Canada are essential for job searches.
Canadian job boards: Check platforms like Job Bank, ITjobs.ca, and BetaKit Jobs for tech-specific listings.
Tech hubs: Focus your search on major tech hubs such as Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal, where most tech jobs are located.
Recruitment agencies: Connect with recruiters specializing in international placements. 
How to apply:
Express Entry: This is a points-based system for skilled workers. Creating a profile and having your skills and credentials assessed is a key step.
Global Talent Stream: This is a faster way to secure a work visa for high-skilled tech jobs. If a Canadian employer hires you for a role under this program, they can often expedite the process.
Networking: Leverage LinkedIn to connect with Canadian recruiters and professionals for referrals, which can be highly effective. 
Australia
Australia's tech sector is experiencing high demand for IT professionals, including freshers. 
Where to find jobs:
Leading job boards: SEEK is Australia's largest job site and a must-use resource. Other popular platforms include LinkedIn, Indeed, and the tech-focused ICTCareer.
Company careers pages: Major tech companies and startups often post entry-level roles directly on their websites. Some leading Australian companies include Atlassian and Canva.
Immigration consultants: Reputable firms like Esse India specialize in assisting Indian tech professionals with job searches and visa applications for Australia. 
How to apply:
Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) visa (Subclass 482): Your Australian employer can sponsor you for this visa to fill a skilled position.
Skilled Independent visa (Subclass 189): For this points-based visa, your occupation must be on the Skilled Occupation List. Freshers can qualify based on their education and other factors.
For fresh graduates: International students who have completed a degree in Australia can apply for a Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485) to gain local experience, which can be a valuable stepping stone. 
Netherlands
The Netherlands has a straightforward visa process for skilled workers and a welcoming tech scene, especially in Amsterdam. 
Where to find jobs:
LinkedIn: The platform is particularly strong in the Dutch job market, with many jobs for developers and other IT roles listed regularly.
Niche job boards: Specialized sites like Relocate.me focus on tech roles with relocation options.
Job fairs and recruitment agencies: Attend tech-focused events and work with recruitment agencies that specialize in placing international talent. 
How to apply:
Highly Skilled Migrant (HSM) visa: For non-EU citizens, this visa is often the fastest and most popular route. The employer must be a recognized sponsor and offer a salary that meets the set threshold for your age and experience level.
The 30% tax ruling: This scheme is an added incentive for highly skilled workers, reducing the taxable income for a specified period.
For fresh graduates: If you graduate from a Dutch university, you may be eligible for a search year visa, which allows you to stay and find a job. 
Ireland
Ireland's growing tech industry, often called the "Silicon Docks" of Dublin, offers a favorable environment for IT professionals. 
Where to find jobs:
Irish job boards: Check popular sites like IrishJobs.ie and the Irish version of Indeed.
Recruitment agencies: Specialist tech recruiters like Hays Technology can assist with finding roles.
Networking: Join tech communities and attend virtual events to connect with the local network. 
How to apply:
Critical Skills Employment Permit: This permit is aimed at attracting highly skilled workers in specific shortage areas, including many IT roles. A job offer is required, and the salary must meet certain thresholds, which are lower for jobs on the critical skills list.
Sourcing a job offer: As with other countries, securing a valid job offer from an Irish employer is the crucial first step before beginning the work visa application process.

Okay Im In india and I dont have visas for any of the said above countries. And also I got my computer science engineering degree at SCAD College of Engineering and Technology which I think doesnt relevant or has any points or edge for me, just another low name college from the sea of colleges. So, is it still possible for me to get a job, by the methods you have said to search on the countries you have said above?
Yes, it is still possible to get a job abroad, but it will be more challenging and will require a strategic approach to overcome the lack of a visa, work experience, and a degree from a top-tier college. Your focus must shift from your college degree to building an outstanding, skills-based profile. 
Here is a breakdown of how you can compensate for your background and use the job search methods effectively for each country.
Strategy for a non-elite college background
Focus on a standout portfolio. Since your college's brand won't open doors, your portfolio is your primary asset. Build several high-quality, real-world projects that showcase your skills in your target role (software developer, DevOps, or IT support). Include details on technologies used, problems solved, and deployment strategies.
Contribute to open-source. This demonstrates your ability to work with others on real projects and is highly valued by international employers. Active contributions can stand in for formal work experience.
Get internationally recognized certifications. This is a critical step to validate your skills beyond your college name. Certifications from AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or Cisco carry significant weight with employers worldwide, particularly for in-demand fields like DevOps and Cloud Computing.
Master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). A strong command of DSA is essential for most software development roles and is a key part of technical interviews at top companies.
Optimize your resume and LinkedIn profile. Tailor your resume for the country you are applying to. For instance, European CVs often differ from Indian formats. Your LinkedIn should be detailed, professional, and showcase your new projects and skills. 
Country-specific strategies for Indian freshers
Germany
The Opportunity Card (Chancenkarte): As a fresher, the new Opportunity Card is a great option. This visa allows you to enter Germany for up to one year to look for a job, even without an offer. You earn points for qualifications, German language skills, relevant professional experience, age, and ties to Germany. A degree is one factor, but strong skills and other qualifications can compensate.
Degree recognition (Anabin): While a degree from a non-elite college can be a hurdle, you can still get it evaluated by the Central Office for Foreign Education (ZAB). If your university is not rated well, you may need additional exams or bridging programs.
Start learning German: Even basic language skills (A2/B1 level) significantly increase your chances, though many tech roles are English-only. Fluency (B2+) can be a major advantage.
Job search: Use sites like GermanTechJobs and LinkedIn, but also consider an internship or trainee position (Praktikum). These are easier to get as freshers and can lead to full-time roles. 
Canada
Provincial Nominee Program (PNP): This is a more realistic pathway than Express Entry for freshers without prior international experience. Some provinces have lower eligibility requirements and can nominate you for permanent residency.
Work experience: Many Canadian employers prefer candidates with local or relevant international experience. Gaining 1-3 years of experience in India first can make you a much stronger candidate for programs like Express Entry.
Networking: Networking with people already in Canada through LinkedIn is crucial. They can provide referrals and insights that can help you secure an interview. 
Australia
General Skilled Migration (GSM): This points-based system is another good option. Your high-demand tech skills and a strong English score can give you an edge.
Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) visa: If you can secure a job offer from an Australian employer, they can sponsor you for a TSS visa. This may be difficult for freshers but not impossible, especially for specialized skills. 
Netherlands & Ireland
Highly Skilled Migrant Visa (Netherlands): You can apply with a valid job offer from a recognized sponsor. While it's easier with a higher salary, strong skills and certifications can make you a compelling candidate even as a fresher.
Critical Skills Employment Permit (Ireland): This permit is specifically for roles with a skills shortage, which includes many IT professions. If you can land a qualifying job offer, the permit allows you to work in Ireland. 
A realistic pathway to consider
While applying directly from India is possible, it is very difficult for freshers without an exceptional profile. A more effective and reliable long-term strategy would be to:
Work in India for 2-3 years: Focus intensely on building your skills, gaining experience, and working on side projects. This experience will make you a much stronger candidate for international roles and immigration programs.
Earn certifications: Pursue relevant certifications during this time.
Apply strategically: Use the experience and certifications gained to re-apply for jobs in your target countries with a much more competitive profile.
